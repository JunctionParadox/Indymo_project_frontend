To whoever continues this project,

I have to apologize for the mess you have to deal with, my time to work on this project was severely limited.

There is a lot functionality missing from this project which I have tried to describe as much as I could in the moments I had writing my final commments.
Generally speaking, there are almost no security measurements which I do regret.
After all I believe security and protecting valuable information is a high priority.
There are some simple token functions implemented and even then, its only purpose as of now is being used in http requests. The contents of the token are not even read by the project itself.

In case you have any questions about continuing this project for Indymo from where I have left off: send a email to NovaSigma89@gmail.com.
